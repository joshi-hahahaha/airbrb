# UI/UX

## FIGMA MOCK UPS

For this assignment, we had utilised Figma to create a quick demo of what we would like our page to look like.

During this time, we took many aspects into consideration. These aspects included: color, shape, size, alignment, fonts and consistency.

We drew a lot of inspiration from the Airbnb website itself.

Here are some examples of our Figma mock up:

### FIGMA EXAMPLES

| EXAMPLE             | Image                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overview            | ![Overview](./mdAssets/bonusAssets/figma1.png)            |
| Register Screen     | ![Register Screen](./mdAssets/bonusAssets/figma2.png)     |
| Listings Page       | ![Listings Page](./mdAssets/bonusAssets/figma3.png)       |
| Create Listing Page | ![Create Listing Page](./mdAssets/bonusAssets/figma4.png) |
| Listing Page        | ![Listing Page](./mdAssets/bonusAssets/figma5.png)        |

We found that this was extremely helpful in guiding us through the process of developing the interface. It provided a way to experiment with components we had in mind and also arrange them the way we wanted.

The struggle of finnicking with styling was minimised.

## SIZE

Sizing of components was important as we wanted our users to be drawn into the more important features, such as the listings themselves and thus, the images for each card were large, obvious and hopefully bright - that would be up to the user's decision for a thumbnail aha

When it comes to optional features, we wanted the users to know and understand that those features were accessiblity and present, so those components were intentionally made smaller. This drew less attention, however, if the user needed to, for example, create a listing, they could very much do so.

## COLOUR + CONTRAST

For this assignment, the main colours were white and a reddish pink. This ensured that the website stayed simple and consistent. As a result, the pinkish red (which one is it? ðŸ‘€) allowed us to apply accentutation on important components. For example, submit buttons on forms or menu button icons overlaying other components.

Additionally, contrast from the colours was great in making the page pop, and again, making certain components and features more important than others.

Another note to mention was that providing some components with shadows, creates a level of elevation over other components, which hopefully draws the user's attention to those components.
